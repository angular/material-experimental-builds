// MDCs default textarea styles cannot be used because they only apply if a special
// class is applied to the "mdc-text-field" wrapper. Since we cannot know whether the
// registered form-field control is a textarea and MDC by default does not have styles
// for textareas in the fill appearance, we add our own minimal textarea styles
// which are scoped to the actual textarea element (i.e. not require a class in the
// text-field wrapper) and integrate better with the any configured appearance.

// Mixin that can be included to override the default MDC text-field styles
// to properly support textareas.
@mixin _mat-mdc-text-field-textarea-overrides() {
  // Ensures that textarea elements inside of the form-field have proper vertical spacing
  // to account for the floating label. Also ensures that there is no vertical text overflow.
  .mat-mdc-textarea-input {
    resize: vertical;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    height: auto;
    // Using padding for textareas causes a bad user experience because the text outside
    // of the text box will overflow vertically. Also, the vertical spacing for controls
    // is set through the infix container to allow for arbitrary form-field controls.
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    border: none;

    // By default IE always renders scrollbars on textarea.
    // This brings it in line with other browsers.
